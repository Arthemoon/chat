# chat

My chat (multi-threaded) application based on TCP protocol with Java FX. It is also connected with MYSQL database and It uses JDBC. 
Application also uses sockets, threads and functional programming.
It uses MVC pattern.

It allows:
 
 - login/registration. Passwords are stored hashed in the database.
 - show friends who are online/offline
 - write to your friend
 - add friend/remove friend/find new friend (second one needs to accept the request or he can refuse it)
 - load chat history with friend
 - make chat room with roles (admin may do some things, other may do some things, other may do nothing... only write) - there functions like -
 add friend to chat, remove, rename room etc, remove other clients, remove rooms... and more
